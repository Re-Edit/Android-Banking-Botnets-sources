## ⚠️ Important Notice 

This archive has been **split into multiple parts** due to GitHub’s 100 MB per file limit.

> ✅ You **must download all parts** before extracting:
- `filename.z01`  
- `filename.z02`  
- ...  
- `filename.zip`

🛑 **Do not attempt to open the `.zip` file alone.** It will not work unless all `.z0x` files are present in the **same folder**.

### 🧩 How to Extract:
1. Download **all parts** (`.z01`, `.z02`, ..., `.zip`)  
2. Place them in the **same folder**  
3. Open the `filename.zip` file using **WinRAR** or **7-Zip**  
4. Extract normally — all parts will be combined automatically
